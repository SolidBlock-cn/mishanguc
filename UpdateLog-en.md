- Added yellow straight line and angle line roads (previously there is only white), yellow cross line roads (previously there is only white), road with white thick T-shaped yellow line (previously there is only road with white normal line with yellow line, and white thick line with yellow double line). Auto-connecting road blocks are adjusted accordingly.

### 0.1.7

Updated following content:

- Added more types of signs, such as wooden signs, ice signs.
- Added handrails. Handrails have multiple styles.
- For force placing tool and fast building tool, in non-water-including mode, if using on waterlogged blocks, then whether the placed block is waterlogged is decided on whether the block at that position before the placement is waterlogged. For example, duplicating a waterlogged block to a non-waterlogged place, the duplicated block is not waterlogged.
- In bi-hand mode, when using force placing tool and fast building tool, the block placed may be influenced by tags `BlockStateTag` and `BlockEntityTag`, to specify the block state and block entity of the block after placing.
- Renamed most road blocks, to solve the problem that names are too long. As old names are no longer recognized, **if you used road blocks previously, after updating this mod, previous road blocks will disappear!** After updating the mod before entering the world, remember to back up the world.
- Added yellow and cyan light blocks, and added stripped light blocks with a background.
- Adjusted the models of light blocks in the inventory.
- Optimized the process of runtime data generation (including resource pack and data pack). Now more data is generated on runtime. Some block states, due to limitations of ARRP mod, still stores json files in mod file.
- Added more block tags.
- Fixed the issue that data tag tool has no tooltip.
- As the heavenly Mojang annotates Block.getName as `@Environment(EnvType.CLIENT)` (only versions before 1.16.5), some tools were switched to client-side usage.
    - Data tag tool still uses server data, but server sends the NBT now, instead of the prettified text.
- Now sign blocks support json texts. You can type `-json <a json>` in a text box, e.g., `-json {color:red,text:Hi}`.
- Added text copy tool, which can be used to copy and paste texts, and allows copy and paste between vanilla signs and mod signs.
- Added the button to flip texts in a sign edit screen, which can be used to flip one line or all lines of text.
- Improved the logic of road connection state debugging tool. Now can view line types.
- Improved some translations according to word-usage and format of vanilla language files.

Fixed following issues:

- Force placing tool and fast building tool may not correctly handle waterlogging, and may not see item tags on the offhand item.
- Force placing tool can remove entity even if you are not in Creative Mode.
- When setting formats for sign text lines, formats may be applied to text itself when rendering.
- In multiplayer mode, some NBT prettified text may lose clicking actions when transmitted to client side, as these clicking action is defined by the mod and cannot be serialized.
- Some data of signs may be stored even if there is no text.

### 0.1.6

Updated following content:

- Invisible glowing signs.
- For Minecraft version Minecraft 1.17 and above, you can set text outlines.
- Improved sign edit screen. You can adjust the order of lines, and cancel the edit.

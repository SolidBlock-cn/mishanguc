### Sign blocks

The mod adds sign blocks in various materials, including hung signs and wall signs. Hung signs can be written on both sides, and when near block or sign bar blocks above, sign bars are displayed. In hung signs, texts correspond to directions, and rotations are not supported, so when placing blocks with NBT, make sure the placing direction consists with when picked, in prevention of disappearance of texts.

The mod contains an invisible sign block, which is invisible, but the text on it is.

All signs are waterloggable. Besides, wall signs can be placed on floor and ceilings, which is different from vanilla.

点击告示牌即可编辑文本。支持多行文本。注意：添加文本时不会自动排版，可点击“重排”按钮对各行进行纵轴方向上的排版（使用重排功能时，启用了“绝对”的文本行会被忽略）。你可以调整各行的大小、偏移、颜色等参数。 Click the sign to edit text. Multiple-line text is supported. Note that when adding a line, texts are not automatically rearranged, and click "Rearrange" button to automatically adjust the vertical position of lines (lines with "Absolute" on will be ignored).

More contents to be added coming soon.

## About API

As some limitations are found with Fabric API, this mod simply extends the API, to fulfill some features without breaking compatibility.

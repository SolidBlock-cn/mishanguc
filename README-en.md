## How to install

This mod relies on Fabric API and [BRRP](https://github.com/SolidBlock-cn/BRRP) (Better Runtime Resource Pack) mod. Please do make sure that BRRP is installed when installing this mod, or the game will not start. BRRP is a branch of [ARRP](https://github.com/Devan-Kerman/ARRP) (Advanced Runtime Resource Pack). Please do not install BRRP and ARRP simultaneously. You do not need to install ARRP even if other mods rely on ARRP, as BRRP includes all features of ARRP.

Only Fabric version. There's no Forge version of this mod.
